# Word Frequency Analysis in Classic Novels

This project explores the linguistic richness of classic literature by analyzing word frequencies across several timeless novels. Utilizing Python, Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Requests, and NLTK, we delve into the textual data to uncover intriguing patterns and insights.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:
- **Extract Data**: Scraped text data from various classic novels using BeautifulSoup and Requests.
- **Process Text**: Employed NLTK for comprehensive text processing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Analyze Word Frequencies**: Computed and visualized word frequency distributions to reveal fascinating insights about word usage in classic literature.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Requests
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK
